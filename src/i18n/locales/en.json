        "answer": "create-next-app gives you a basic Next.js starter. The Architech gives you a production-ready application with authentication, database, payments, and all integrations configured and working together. It's the difference between an empty house and a fully furnished home."

        "question": "Can I use this in production?",
        "answer": "Yes! The Architech generates production-ready code following enterprise-grade best practices. You get TypeScript, ESLint, testing setup, security configurations, and scalable architecture out of the box. No cleanup or refactoring needed."

Industry studies confirm it: according to Software.com, developers spend an average of only 52 minutes per day on actual, active coding. Research from Stripe shows that up to 42% of their time is consumed by managing technical debt, often born from a flawed initial setup.\n\nWe spend our time as overburdened artisans when we should be visionary architects."

The real revolution isn't replacing the artisan; it's changing the production line.\n\nWorse, today's AI transforms the exciting role of the developer into a dehumanizing job of verifying and fixing a machine's errors.

My goal is to elevate you, to free you from thankless tasks so you can focus on what brought you to development in the first place: the desire to innovate, to think, and to build.\n\nThe Architech is the first stone. It is a pragmatic tool to solve a problem of today. But it is built on a foundation—modularity, open standards, and ownership—that prepares for the sovereign Internet of tomorrow.\n\nIf this vision of freeing human creativity from useless constraints resonates with you, then join us.\n\n- Antoine"
