      question: "What technologies are supported?",
      answer: "The Architech is tech-agnostic. It starts with popular stacks (React, Node.js, Python, etc.), and the community can add modules for any technology. Our modular architecture means you're never locked into a specific tech stack."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I really own my code?",
      answer: "Yes, 100%. The Architech generates standard, clean, exportable code. There is absolutely no vendor lock-in. You get production-ready code that you can modify, deploy, and maintain independently. It's yours forever."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the business model?",
      answer: "The Architech Core will be open source. Premium features, like advanced AI agents, enterprise integrations, and priority support, will be available via a fair and transparent subscription model. We believe in sustainable open source."
    },
    {
      question: "How does this differ from other AI coding tools?",
      answer: "Unlike generic AI assistants that generate code snippets, The Architech uses specialized agents to create complete, modular applications. You're not debugging AI-generated codeâ€”you're orchestrating expert systems that understand best practices in their domains."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a learning curve?",
      answer: "The Architech is designed for developers, by developers. If you understand modern application architecture, you'll feel at home immediately. The modular approach actually simplifies complex applications by making them more predictable and maintainable."
    },
    {
      question: "When will it be available?",
      answer: "We're currently in closed alpha with select developers and teams. Join our waitlist to get early access and help shape the future of development tools. Beta access will be available in Q2 2024."
